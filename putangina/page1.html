                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Ukay-ukay has been synonymous to rare gems and endless style possibilities. Thrift stores, however, are like a big labyrinth you should master to really uncover the treasures. With that, it’s time to channel that inner ukay savant in you and pop some tags. Here are the 5 must-know ukay-
<br>
<br>1. KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT
<br>Make a list of the things you are looking for. Ukay-ukay shops offer so many stuff that shoppers tend to forget the very thing they’re planning to buy the moment they step into the store.
<br>
<br>It’s easy to get lost through racks, grabbing everything that looks pretty and the next thing you know, you’re at the cashier, paying for a lot of items–clothes you’ll later realize they don’t need or want in the first place.
<br>
<br>You don’t want to be that mindless shopper and a big spender. Be strategic. Have a list of items you want, so you know where to begin the search when you enter the store. This will not just save money but also precious time.
<br>
<br>ukay tips for scoring thrifty finds:
<br>
<br>2. RANSACK THE RACK
<br>The style gems come to those who rummage the racks.
<br>
<br>Smart ukay-ukay shoppers are the epitome of patience. They go through racks and piles of clothes in the name of fashion and style. Take on that virtue and ransack the racks. Don’t just brush the surface; rare gems are often buried underneath the old, old clothes, so dig deep.
<br>
<br>You may also want to bring a shopping bag, where you can keep the clothes you find.
<br>
<br>3. COLLECT, COLLECT, AND THEN SELECT
<br>If you find something you like, but you’re having second thoughts about buying it, don’t return it to the pile just yet. Keep it and just look for more items. It’s better to hoard than to lose one potential gem.
<br>
<br>When you’re ready to buy, take a look at the items you got and see which ones are worth the purchase. Go back to your list as well. Check if you have everything you need. Then, return the items you don’t want.
<br>
<br>4. INSPECT EACH ITEM
<br>Remember, ukay-ukay items are second-hand, so you have to check if they’re in good condition–or at least in a salvageable state. Some items can be fixed with a few patches and cover-ups here and there.
<br>
<br>As you consider each flaw, think about the costs of repair as well. Can you fix it yourself? Do you have to take it to alteration shops? How much will it cost you? Sometimes, there are flaws that turn out to be more expensive than the actual price of the item. In these cases, you may have to let go of them (sad but true).
<br>
<br>5. TRY THEM OUT
<br>It’s important to try the clothes on so you will know if it looks good on you. Sometimes, clothes just look pretty from a distance. They’re much different when you try them on. Or, sometimes, you realize the clothes aren’t really your style once they’re on you. Wear the clothes, so you’ll also know if there are necessary alterations.
<br>
<br>Remember to wear simple, comfortable clothes when you shop so you can easily try the clothes on, without having to go to the fitting room, as some ukay-ukay stores also don’t have such areas.
<br>
<br>6. HAGGLE
<br>This is perhaps the most crucial money-saving tip. Haggling is a necessary part of the ukay-ukay shopping experience. Brush up on your persuasive skills and prepare your “haggling speech.” Try asking for a bigger discount, especially if you’re buying in bulk.
<br>
<br>Ukay-ukay shopping could be the answer to your tight budget issues and fashion cravings. Keep these strategies in mind and have an awesome shopping experience!

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    Fashion isn’t always about the price point of the things we wear. As we deem fashion as art, we take pride in knowing that we can whip up a good outfit even without the hefty price tag. Plus, who says nice clothes can only be found in boutiques and malls? Ukay-ukay or thrift shopping is always an option. Although mind you, it’s not for the faint-hearted! To serve as your guide, we talk with experienced thrift shoppers on what they’ve learned over time when it comes to navigating the ukay-ukay.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">1. Know what’s trending.
<br>
<br>Preview‘s Maura Rodriguez shares, “Always check the runway trends first or what’s currently in store. I brush up on fashion trends to get an idea on what to look for before thrift-shopping. This is super helpful if your personal style isn’t the typical ‘vintage’ or ‘retro’ aesthetic, and it will narrow down your choices to a specific type of style or item.”
<br>
<br>2. Shop with intent.
<br>
<br>Maura adds, “If you want frayed denim jeans or a ruffled top or dress, and if you [already] have that in mind before shopping, it’ll make the experience less overwhelming.”
<br>
<br>3. Don’t be fooled by the tags.
<br>
<br>Model Jessica Yang reminds us, “Don’t get things you don’t need just because they are way too cheap.”
<br>
<br>4. Be physically prepared.
<br>
<br>“If you’re allergic to dust, take meds to prevent any uncomfortable experiences while shopping,” Maura says. To which, blogger Steffi Ziebert adds, “Use a face mask while shoppping, so you don’t get allergies from the dust.”
<br>
<br>5. Remember the dates 15 and 30.
<br>
<br>Maura explains, “These are also called ‘payday dates’ and usually ukays go on sale before the 15th and 30th. Like, 3-for-100 bargains!”
<br>
<br>6. Hoard and then double check.
<br>
<br>“If you like something, get it right away and then park yourself in a corner and start checking each piece meticulously for damages or stains,” Maura warns.
<br>
<br>7. With ukay-ukay, you need patience.
<br>
<br>Steffi says, “Most of the time, there’s bound to be even one item you’d like.  It’s not all about where or which ukay you go to.” To which Jessica adds, “[Ukay-ukay] is basically treasure hunting. You need to be patient.” Photographer Shaira Luna even shares her shopping technique: start with the rack with the lowest price tags!
<br>
<br>8. Try on items you see that you like.
<br>
<br>Steffi reminds us that “ukay items don’t have the same sizes as usual retail stores, so it’s better to try them on.” If you’re worried about hygiene, you may want to check out Shaira’s nifty trick here.
<br>
<br>9. “Always bring hand sanitizer.”
<br>
<br>Ukay-ukay clothes have gone through a lot. So after browsing through racks of clothes, “wash your hands or use a hand sanitizer,” Steffi advises. Don’t forget to thoroughly launder the clothes, too!
